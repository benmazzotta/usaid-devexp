This file describes the Development Experience Clearinghouse 1989 metadata file.

The source of the data is a hackathon [project](https://github.com/dbarlett/USAID-DEC) by Dylan Barlett. It is transcribed from USAID's [repository of PDFs](https://dec.usaid.gov/). Perhaps in response to [this challenge](https://github.com/pdfliberation/pdf-hackathon/blob/master/challenges/usaid-challenge.md). See also, [forked by USAID](https://github.com/USAID/USAID-DEC).

At the time of access, Barlett's file had extracted all metadata from documents in years 1947-1989. Ben guesses he used [Tabula](https://dec.usaid.gov/)---see also on [Github](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula)---for this.
