It is transcribed from USAID's [repository of PDFs](https://dec.usaid.gov/). Perhaps in response to [this challenge](https://github.com/pdfliberation/pdf-hackathon/blob/master/challenges/usaid-challenge.md). See also, [forked by USAID](https://github.com/USAID/USAID-DEC).\n\nAt the time of access, Barlett's file had extracted all metadata from documents in years 1947-1989. Ben guesses he used [Tabula](https://dec.usaid.gov/)---see also on [Github](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula)---for this. \n\n## Basic description\n\nWhat's in the datset?\n\n```{r import}\nload(\"../data/dec1989.Rda\")\n\n## How big is it?\ndim(dec)\n\n## What fields does it have?\nnames(dec)\n\n## What is the structure?\nstr(dec)\n```\n\n> End of file.\n",
